I am an ambitious backend software engineer; looking for a role where I can consolidate and push my programming knowledge to its limits, while also gaining exposure to new and exciting aspects of the programming field.


## Professional Experience

### Part-time Freelance Web Developer
##### [Art eCommerce platform](https://mrdswireart.github.io/): July 2023 - Present
*Main technologies used: python (django) · postgreSQL · javascript (react) · HTML · CSS · bootstrap · github pages*

On a part-time basis, I have been working for a client to create an art eCommerce website, so that he can list and sell his art pieces. I quickly realised that ~80% of the functionality required could be achieved in a simple MVP, which has now been delivered and can be found at: https://mrdswireart.github.io/. Having completed the research, planning and architectural designs for the full functionality version and admin site, I have now started work on the various codebases.

Handling the whole project by myself has meant a lot of work, requiring the undertaking of a wide range of tasks, normally handled by multiple departments. However, among other benefits, it has allowed me to gain exposure and experience in area's I wouldn't normally; Such as communicating directly with the client in a 'product' capacity. It was key to understand clearly what the client required of the platform, then to implement any feedback. Furthermore, working in a team of one has given me complete freedom to choose technologies and make architectural decisions as I deem appropriate.

### Software Engineer
##### Eigen Technologies: November 2021 - June 2022
*Main technologies used: python (django) · javascript · node · AWS · teamcity · sql · docker · kubernetes*

When I first joined Eigen, an AI document processing company, I was primarily using python, with django as the framework; I got straight to work, improving the new dev environment set up process and documentation; whilst also delivering production code in my first week. One of our main objectives of my first squad was to replace, then remove a well ingrained, but now redundant, concept. I was then solely responsible for implementing this change in their cli for porting data.

My next squad was responsible for fixing certain issues with pdf processing. While the problem’s effects were clear, the reasons and solutions were not. It required deep dives, and many spikes, to fully understand the root cause and subsequently implement the fixes. Adding to the complexity, most of the code was in JavaScript. This meant the squad first had to up-skill to be capable of handling these issues. 

Throughout my time at Eigen I contributed to documentation, reported and addressed bugs, tech debt and messy code. When a new junior joined our squad, I paired with and mentored her as much as possible. Culminating with both of us presenting in our squad demo to the engineer team of 50. I also took various workshops for such things as writing clean code and refactoring.

##### Hummingbird Technologies: January 2018 - August 2021
*Main technologies used: php (symfony) · python (fastAPI) · sql · GCP · circleCI · graphQL · docker*

While at Hummingbird, an AI agriculture company, I mainly worked with PHP. However, towards the end of my tenure I moved more to python. Having spent most of my time in the backend, I also had to tackle everything from tech support and QA, to database and dev ops. I took every opportunity to pair with the data scientists and frontend developers, organising weekly knowledge sharing / pairing sessions.

Given the start-up nature of Hummingbird, and it’s infancy when I joined, I had to take my learning into my own hands while also being able to handle anything that landed on my plate. This has helped me to be versatile and adaptable. Those circumstances allowed a lot of room to contribute to how we wanted to work, define processes and which methodologies to follow; such things as TDD, OOP and Agile, both scrum and kanban.

Whilst at Hummingbird I worked on a variety of projects and functionality; everything from adding some of the core code, integrating external partners, overhauling redundant concepts, rebuilding legacy code into microservices with a focus on scalability and maintainability, to being tech lead on a standalone project.


## Skills

- **Communication** - Working at a pub has helped hone my communication and social skills due to the extended interaction with a wide assortment of people and characters. This has further been helped by my time at university, makers, Hummingbird and Eigen; where group discussions and work were commonplace, requiring a professional and rational approach to dealing with conflict.

- **Problem-Solving** - Studying law at university helped improve my analytical skills; I also enjoy puzzles such as crosswords, sudoku or code-wars katas. This helps me look at complex problems and break them into simple, manageable chunks.

- **Quick Learner** - Makers was only three months long, and I have been required to pick up new languages for work. This meant a lot of information that I had to absorb, understand and apply quickly.

- **Inquisitive** - Whenever I'm told something is the way it is, just because it is; I always have to know why. It's what pushes me to learn more and expand my knowledge.

- **Management** - Through my involvement with multiple musical productions, I have had to manage my and others' time effectively whilst keeping everyone focused and on track.

- **Creative** - I love getting involved with anything musical: playing in a band or helping a friend produce his compositions. I apply this improved creativity to build inventive solutions to complex challenges.

## Hobbies and Interests

My favourite pastime is gaming, from video games to board games to recent Dungeons & Dragons-er. Although I've spent most of my time playing, I have also made a few simple text-based adventure games. I recently learnt some C# to mod a PC game that didn't quite have the functionality I wanted. 

Trying to get a break from the screen, I like spending time outdoors, walking and training my two dogs. I have been on multiple camping trips and walks, including from Carlisle to Edinburgh! I also enjoy sports: bouldering, tennis, skiing, sailing and clay pigeon shooting. 

One of my oldest interests is anything musical: listening, playing or producing. I can play a few instruments and have performed at a local festival.
